  - Updated emoji from ðŸ’§ to ðŸ’¡
  - New metric shows runtime in seconds/minutes/hours based on value
  - Benefits: More intuitive, direct energy comparison, no regional variance
  - Formula: `lightBulbMinutes = (energyWh / 60) * 60`

### Updated
- Updated manifest description to reflect new metrics
- Updated methodology.md with light bulb runtime explanation
- Updated TESTING.md to reflect new metric expectations

  - Recalculation when switching estimation methods now works properly

### Improved
- **Eliminated code duplication** (Issue #14)
