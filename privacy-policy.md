### **1. Overview**

This Chrome extension is designed solely to help users estimate the environmental impact of their AI usage, specifically their interactions with ChatGPT. The extension processes data locally to calculate approximate energy usage and CO₂ emissions per session.

We respect your privacy. This extension does **not collect**, **store**, or **share** any personal information. All computations are done locally in your browser.

### **2. Data Collection and Usage**

The extension processes the following types of data **strictly locally for the purpose of calculating environmental metrics**:

- **User Interaction Data**
  Detects when you interact with the ChatGPT interface (e.g., opening a ChatGPT tab or submitting a prompt). This is used to trigger environmental impact calculations.

- **Message Content**
  The text of your interactions with ChatGPT may be analyzed **locally** to estimate the number of tokens used. This data is never stored, sent, or shared.

- **Local Usage History**
  Environmental impact statistics (e.g., energy usage and emissions over time) are saved locally using browser storage. These values remain entirely on your device and are only accessible to the extension.
